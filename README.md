### Attacks

1. **dummy_a.csv**
   - Description: Dataset containing various types of attacks recorded simultaneously.

### Benign Scenarios

1. **dummy_b.csv**
   - Description: Benign data recorded on the first day.

### Metadata

1. **dummy_metadata.json**
   - Description: JSON file containing metadata for the dataset.

### Python Scripts

1. **dummy_python.py**
   - Description: Python script for analyzing the dataset.
